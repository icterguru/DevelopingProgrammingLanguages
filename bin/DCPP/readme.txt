#######Features supported:

yes	comments 
yes	integers and strings
yes	dynamically typed (like Scheme and Python)
yes	classes/objects
yes	arrays with O(1) access time
yes	conditionals
yes	recursion
yes	iteration
yes	convenient means to print to the console
yes	an adequate set of operators
yes	functions as first-class objects (i.e. functions can be manipulated as in 		Scheme - e.g. local functions)
yes	(graduate only) delayed evaluation of function arguments

*function name in class: it should have prefix “function_” to let processor know that it is a function in class. The functions’ name outside do not need to follow this rule.

*Possible extra credits: I implemented lexical analyzer very carefully, maybe I can get some extra credit for it.

yes	make environmentTest #show the environment works
